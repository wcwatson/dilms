# DILMS | Digital Index of Late Medieval Song

The Digital Index of Late Medieval Song is an interactive database that aims to describe every inscription of vernacular polyphony from 15th-century Europe. Its original pre-pre-release version was constructed as part of my dissertation project, ["Circulating Song from the Century before Print (2020)."][1] The current release may, of course, be found at [dilms.org][2], and my article describing it, **~TK~**, may be found at **~TK~**.
